# Integrated-Hybrid-Video-Compression-using-MATLAB
This is a Video compression codec done in MATLAB for the UCF-101 dataset. This mainly focuses on Motion Estimation and Compensation with an addition of Quad Tree variable size decoding.

Video compression plays a pivotal role in managing the storage and transmission of multimedia content, especially in bandwidth-constrained environments. This project presents an integrated hybrid video compression framework that combines traditional techniques such as motion estimation and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coding with machine learning methodologies. The framework aims to improve compression efficiency and maintain high-quality video output through intelligent prediction and optimization. The project utilizes the UCF101 dataset, a widely used benchmark for action recognition in videos, to validate and train machine learning models integrated into the compression pipeline. By leveraging the dataset's diverse set of video clips covering 101 action categories, the framework incorporates machine learning for tasks such as enhancing motion estimation accuracy and optimizing compression strategies based on learned patterns.
